PREFACE
CHEMISTRY GRADE - 9 is developed according to the National Curriculum 2006 and
National Style Guide. It is being published since 2012 and in 2015 it was presented under the
new management and supervision of textbook development principles and guidelines with new
design and layout. n
Chemistry is one of the most exciting and useful subjects.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
It may not be aon easy subject
for you. If you develop a sound approach to thinking through an idea and solving problem, you
i
will find it easy. This textbook provides several ways to develop this approacth. a
This textbook has been made friendly by giving problem solving strategy. This strategy is
to facilitate reasoning, not memorizing toward a solution. With edach skill or concept, self-
assessment exercises have been given.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
These exercises would encourage students to think,
n
develop skills and use information for a variety of purpose. u
It is caused of development of skills such as questioning, observing, inferring, and
predicting, measuring, hypothesizing, classifying, deosigning experiments, collecting data,
analyzing data and interpreting data. At the end of each chapter summary of the key points is
F
given. This provides quick reviews of the salient features of each chapter.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Science, Technology and Society conknections have also been given in each chapter. These will help to understand the impact of science and technology on society. Students will
o
learn how scientists decide what constitute scientific knowledge, how science is related to other
o
ways of knowledge and how people have contributed to and influenced developments in science. This textbook has been deBveloped according to Student-Centered Inquiry Based (SCIB)
criteria.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
It will encourage students to develop skills and think scientifically rather than simply
memorize and study scientiflic facts. It is also expected from teachers that they will engage
a
students in scientific inquiry activities to develop such skills. Our efforts aren to make textbooks teachable with quality, i. e. maintaining of standards. It
is a continuous effort and we will get feedback of the yearly feasibility reports and redesign the
o
textbook every year.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
The test items given in the exercises are for learning reinforcement. The
i
examination questions should be prepared according to the SLO’s and Bloom’s Taxonomy. t
Qauality of Standards, Pedagogical Outcomes, Taxonomy Access and Actualization of
Style is our motto. With these elaborations, this series of new development was presented for
N
use. After educational feedback, research, NCC Standards 2016, the book is being published
again.

1. 2 BASIC DEFINITIONS
Some of the important definitions used to understand matter are given below:
1. 2. 1 Elements, Compounds and Mixtures
Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter. Any matter that has a
particular set of characteristics that differ from the characteristics of another kind of matter is
called a substance.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
For instance, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, urea, glucose, common salt
etc are different substances. 11
1 Fundamentals of Chemistry
A substance that cannot be converted to other simpler substances is called an
element. For example substances like oxygen, hydrogen, iron, copper, aluminium etc are
elements. An element is now defined as a substance whose all the atoms have the same atomic
number.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
A compound is a pure substance that consists of two or more elements held
together in fixed proportions by natural forces called chemical bonds. The properties of
n
compounds are different from the properties of the elements from which they are formed. For

Solution:
Number of protons = atomic number = 17
Number of neutrons = mass number – atomic number

3 Relative Atomic Mass and Atomic Mass Unit
n
The first quantitative information about atomic masses came from the work of Dalton, Gay
Lussac, Lavoisier, Avogadro and Berzelius. By observing the proportions in wohich elements
combine to form various compounds, nineteenth century chemists calculated relative atomic
i
masses. An atom is extremely small particle; therefore we cannot determine tthe mass of a single
atom.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
However, it is possible to determine the mass of one atom of an eleament relative to another
experimentally. This can be done by assigning a value to the mass of one atom of a given
d
element, so that it can be used as standard. By international agreement in 1961, light isotope of
n
carbon C-12 has been chosen as a standard. This isotope of carbon(C-12) has been assigned
a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass unit. This value has beenu determined accurately using mass
spectrometer.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
The mass of atoms of all other elements are compared to the mass C-12. Thus
o
“the mass of an atom of an element relative to the mass of an atom of C-12 is called its
F
relative atomic mass”. One atomic mass unit (amu) is defined as a mass exactly equal to one-twelfth the mass
k
of one C-12 atom. o
Mass of one C-12 atom = 12 amu

4 Empirical Formula, Molecular Formula
Recall that the chemical formula of a compound tells us which elements are present in it
and the whole number ratio of their atoms. In a chemical formula element’s symbol and
numerical subscripts show the type and the number of each atom in a compound. There are
several types of chemical formulas for a compound. Here you will learn about two types of
chemical formulas. n

---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Empirical Formula
o
The empirical formula of a compound is the chemical formula that gives the
i
simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element. For example in compound hydrogen
t
peroxide there is one H atom for every O atom. Therefore, simplest ratio of hydrogen to oxygen
a
is 1: 1. So the empirical formula of hydrogen peroxide is written as HO. d

Molecular Formula u
A molecular formula gives the actual whole number ratio of atoms of each element
o
present in a compound. For example there are actually two H atoms and two O atoms in
F
each molecule of hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, actual ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms is
2 : 2. So molecular formula of hydrogen perox ide is H O. k 2 2

The term molecular mass is used for molecular compounds. Whereas, the term formula
mass is used for ionic compounds. Ionic compounds consist of arrays of oppositely charged ions
rather than separate molecules. So we represent an ionic compound by its formula unit. A
formula unit indicates the simplest ratio between cations and anions in an ionic compound. For
example, the common salt consists of Na+ and Cl− ions.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
It has one Na+ ion for every Cl−ion. So
formula unit for common salt is NaCl. The sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the formula unit of a substance is called
formula mass. 15

3 CHEMICAL SPECIES
Most of the matter is composed of molecules or ions, formed by atoms. 16
1 Fundamentals of Chemistry
1. 3. 1 Ions (Cation, Anions), Molecular Ions and Free Radicals
Atom is the smallest particle of an element that cannot exist in free state. It is electrically
neutral. On the other hand an ion is a charged species formed from an atom or chemically
bonded groups of atoms by adding or removing electrons.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Positively charged ions are called
cations, whereas, the negatively charged ions are called anions. An ionic compound
contains anions and cations in such number that the conmpound is
electrically neutral. Metal atoms generally lose one or more
o
electrons and form cations. For example Na forms Na+ by losing
i
one electron, Ca forms Ca+2 by losing two electrons. The Non-metal
t
atoms usually gain one or more electronsa and form anions.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
For
example a chlorine atom gains one electron and forms Cl− ion. An
d
O-atom gains two electrons and forms O−2 ion. n
Let us understand why an ion acquires a net positive or
negative charge. Consider the fuormation of Na+ ion. Fig. 1. 2 Na+ ion
Figure 1. 2 shows the sodium ion. Note that sodioum has a nucleus of 11 protons and 12
neutrons. Thus its nucleus has a total charge of +11. Around the nucleus, there are 10 electrons,

with a total charge of -10.

Molecular Ion

Wahen a molecule loses or gains one or more electrons, the resulting species is
called a molecular ion. For example O when loses one electron it forms O+ ion, but when it

Similarly N−, N+

etc are examples of molecular ions. These are short lived species and only exist at high
temperature. Molecular ions do not form ionic compounds. Free Radicals
A free radical is an atom which has an unpaired electron and bears no electrical
charge. For example
are free radicals

TO ATOMIC STRUCTURE
In grade VII you have learned about the structure of atom and sub-atomic particles. You
have also learned the distribution of electrons in shells (KLM only) using 2n2 formula. In this
section you will learn about theories and experiments related to atomic structure. 31
2 Structure of Atoms
2. 1. 1 Rutherford’s Atomic Model
In 1911 Rutherford performed an experiment in order to know the arrangement of
electrons and protons in atoms. 2. 1. 1.

1 Rutherford’s Experiment
Rutherford bombarded a very thin gold foil about
n
0. 00004cm thickness with α-particles. (figure 2. 1). He
o
used α-particles obtained from the disintegration of
i
polonium. α-particles are helium nuclei that are doubly
t
positively charged (He++). Most of these particles a
passed straight through the foil. Only few particles were
d
slightly deflected. But one in 1 million was deflected
n
through an angle greater than 90o from their straight
paths.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Rutherford performed a series of experiments u
using thin foils of other elements. He observed similar
o

results from these experiments. F
Rutherford drew the following conclusions:
1. Since majority of the α-particles passed th rough the foil undeflected, most of the space
k
occupied by an atom must be empty. 2.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
The deflection of a few α-particles o through angles greater than 90o shows that these
particles are deflected by eleoctrostatic repulsion between the positively charged α-
particles and the positively charged part of atom. B
3. Massive α-particles are not deflected by electrons. On the basis of conclusions drawn from these experiments, Rutherford proposed a new
l
model for an atom. He praoposed a planetary model (similar to the solar system) for an atom. An
atom is a neutral particle.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
The mass of an atom is concentrated in a very small dense positively
n
charged region. He named this region as nucleus. The electrons are revolving around the
o
nucleus in circles. These circles are called orbits. The centripetal force due to the revolution of
electrons balanices the electrostatic force of attraction between the nucleus and the electrons. t
2. 1. 1. 2 Defects in Rutherford’s Atomic Model

Rutherford’s model of an atom resembles our solar system. It has following defects:

---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Classical physics suggests that electron being charged particle will emit energy
continuously while revolving around the nucleus. Thus the orbit of the revolving electron
becomes smaller and smaller until it would fall into the nucleus. This would collapse the
atomic structure. 2. If revolving electron emits energy continuously it should form a continuous spectrum for
an atom but a line spectrum is obtained.

3 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATION
k
To understand electronic configuration, you should know about shells and sub-shells. o
2. 3. 1 Shells
o
According to Bohr’s atomic theory, the electron in an atom revolves around the nucleus in one of
the circular paths called shells or orbits. Each shell has a fixed energy. So each shell is also called energy
B
level. Each shell is described by an n value. n can have values 1,2,3…. When,
l
n = 1, it is Ka shell
n = 2, it is L shell
n
n = 3, it is M shell etc.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
o
As the value of n increases the distance of electron from the nucleus and energy of the
i
shell increastes. a
2. 3. 2 Sub-Shells
N
A shell or energy level is sub divided into sub-shells or sub-energy levels. n value of a
shell is placed before the symbol for a sub-shell. For instance
n = 1, for K shell. It has only one sub-shell which as represented by 1s. For L shell n =2, L shell has two sub-shells, these are designated as 2s and 2p.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
For M shell n =3 So M shell has 3 sub-shells called 3s , 3p and 3d. While N shell has 4s, 4p, 4d
and 4f sub-shells. s sub-shell can accommodate maximum 2 electrons. p sub-shell can accommodate maximum 6 electrons. 37
2 Structure of Atoms
d sub-shell can accommodate maximum 10 electrons. f sub-shell can accommodate maximum 14 electrons. The increasing order of energy of the sub-shells belonging to different shells is given below. 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p< 4s< 3d ….
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
The arrangement of electrons in sub-shells is called as the electronic connfiguration. We can fill the electrons present in various elements by using Auf Bau Principle. According to
o
this principle, electrons fill the lowest energy sub-shell that is available first. This means
i
electron will fill first 1s, then 2s, then 2p and so on. t
2. 3. 3 Electronic Configuration of First 18 Elementsa. Electronic configuration is the distribution of electrons damong the different sub-
shells of an atom.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
We can do this by listing the symbol for the occupied subs-shells one after
n
another. Show the number of electrons in the sub-shell as a superscript to each symbol. Because
u
the energies of sub-shells increase in the order, 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p (as indicated in section 2. 2. 1),
the first five sub-shells fill in that order. Hydrogen haso atomic number 1. So it has only one
electron that will occupy lowest energy sub-shell 1s. The electronic configuration of H is 1s1.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
F
Helium has atomic number 2, so it has two electrons. Since s sub-shell can accommodate
two electrons, so electronic configuration of Hke is 1s2. Lithium has atomic number 3, so it has three electrons, two will fill 1s sub-shell and one
o
2s sub-shell. So electronic configuration of Li is 1s22s1. o
Beryllium has atomic number 4, so it has four electrons. Two of these electrons go into1s
B
sub-shell and two will go to 2s sub-shell. Thus electronic configuration of Be is 1s22s2.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Once 2s sub-shell is fille d, the 2p sub-shell begins to fill. 2p sub-shell can hold maximum
l
6 electrons. So next six elements will have configuration in which 2p sub-shell will be
a
progressively filled. Therefore, these elements will have following electronic configuration.

Ar has 3s2 3p6 valence shell configuration

3. 2 PERIODICITY OF PROPERTIES
In section 3. 1. 4 you learned that, the electronic configuration of elements show a periodic
variation with the increasing atomic number. Therefore, the elements also show periodic
variation in their physical and chemical properties. Elements having similar valence shell
electronic configuration have been placed in the same group, one below the other.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Chemical
n
properties depend on the valence shell electronic configuration. Because all the elements of a
particular group have similar valence shell electronic configuration, they poossess similar
chemical characteristics. Physical properties depend on the sizes of atoms. Since sizes of atoms

change gradually from top to bottom in a group. Therefore, elements show gtradation in physical
properties in the same group.

All the physical and chemical properties of the elements depend on the electronic

configurations of their atoms. Now we will discuss four properties of atoms that are influenced
by the electronic configuration: atomic size, ionoization energy, electron affinity and
electronegativity. These properties are periodic.

They generally increase and decrease in a

recurring or repeating manner through the periodic table. This means they show consistent
changes or trends, within a group or a period. These trends correlate with the behaviour. k
3. 2. 2 Atomic Size
o
The size of an atom depends on its electronic configuration. The size of an atom is the
o
average distance between the nucleus of an atom and the outer electronic shell. Figure
B
3. 3 shows atomic radii of the main group elements. Figure 3.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
3 shows the va riation in atomic radii in a period and within a group. You can see
l
two general trends in atomic radii. a
(1) The atomicn radius decreases in any given period as you move across the period. This
is because as you move from one element to the next on its right in a period. Another
o
electron is added to the same valence shell. At the same time positive charge on the
nucleius also increases by 1. The attractive force of the nucleus for the valence shell
t
electron increases.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Therefore, the shell size and atomic radius decreases. For
a
example, in going from lithium to beryllium, atomic size decreases. This you can
N
understand from the valence shell electronic configuration of Li (2s1) and B (2s2). In
going from Li to Be, there is no change in the shell number n, but atomic number
increases from 3 to 4. Due to this the force of the nucleus for the valence shell electron
increases. Therefore, atomic radius decreases.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
The atomic radius increases in any given main group as you move down the group of
elements. This is because the size of an atom is determined by the size of its valence shell. As
you move to the next lower element in the group, the atom has an additional shell of electrons. This increases atomic radius. For example, in going from Li to Na atomic radius increases. 53

Electron affinity is defined as the amount
of energy releiased when an electron adds up in the valence shell of an isolated atom to

form a uninegative gaseous ion. a
N
X(g) + e− ⎯⎯→X−(g) + electron affinity
Figure 3. 5 shows electron affinities of main group elements. As you move from left to right across a period, the electron affinity generally increases. This is due to increase in nuclear charge and decrease in atomic radius, which binds the extra
electron more tightly to the nucleus.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
But shielding effect remains constant in each period. Therefore, alkali metals have lowest and halogens have the highest electron affinities in each
period. 56
3 Periodic Table And Periodicity Of Properties
The electron affinity decreases from top to bottom in a group. This is due to increase in
shielding effect. Due to increase in shielding effect added electron binds less tightly to the
nucleus. As a result less energy is released.

Key Points
o
• When elements are arraBnged in the order of their increasing atomic number, their
properties are repeated in a periodic manner. • A horizontal row of ele l ments in the periodic table is called a period. a
• A column of elements in the periodic table is called a group or a family.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
• Group IA andn IIA elements are called s-block elements, since s sub-shell fills in these
elements. o
• Elements in group IIIA to VIIIA are called p-block elements, because filling of valence p
i
sub-shell occurs in these elements. t
• The length of a period in the periodic table depends on the type of sub-shell that fills. a
• The decrease in force of attraction between nucleus and the valence electron by the
N
electrons present in the inner sub-shells is called shielding effect.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
• The size of atom is the average distance between the nucleus of an atom and the outer
electronic shell. • The atomic radii decrease from left to right in a period. Whereas these increase from top
to bottom in a group. • Ionization energy is the minimum amount of energy required to remove the outermost
electron from an isolated gaseous atom.

You
noticed that each period on the periodic table starts with alkali metal (except period I that starts

with hydrogen) and ends at a noble gas. The noble gases have ns2np6 electronic configuration
in the outer most shell. These elements are sometimes called the inert gases. This is because
they do not participate in chemical reactions.

Electronic configurations of first three noble gases
are shown below:

Note that these elements have completely filled outer most s and p suib-shells. Helium

contains two electrons and remaining noble gases contain 8 electrons in the valence shell. a
Because of these configuration noble gases are stable and not active. In 1916 a chemist G. N. Lewis used this fact to explain why atoms undergo chemicald reactions.

He called his
explanations as Octet Rule. An octet is a set of eight. In forming ncompounds, atoms tend to gain
electronic configuration of a noble gas. Remember that each noble gas (except He) has eight

about noble gases. o

Electronic structure of an atomu helps us to understand how atoms
are held together to form substances. Atoms other than the noble gases have a tendency to

2 Covalent Bonds
In the preceding section you have learned the formation of ionic bonds between two
atoms. Ionic compounds such as NaCl, are crystalline solids with high melting points. However,
some compounds have very different properties. HCl is a gas at room temperature. Water (H O)
2
is a liquid. Such compounds are not ionic. These compounds are made up of non-metal atoms. Non–metals have high ionization energies, therefore, they do not lose electrons.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
Non–metal
4 Structure of Molecules 69
atoms tend to share electrons among themselves or with other non–metal atoms to form a
chemical bond called covalent bond. A Covalent bond is formed by mutual sharing of
electrons between two atoms. Consider the formation of covalent
bond in hydrogen molecule. A hydrogen
atom has a single valence electron. Two
n
hydrogen atoms share their valence
o
electrons to form a diatomic molecule.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
i

a
In the formation of this molecule, each hydrogen atom achieves the electron configuration
d
of the noble gas, helium which has two valence electrons. An electron pair in the region between
the two atoms is attracted to both hydrogen nuclei. This means nit is a more stable situation than
that exists in separate atoms. Because of this stability two atoms form a covalent bond.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
u
We can represent the formation of a covalent bond between two atoms using electron-
o
dot and electron-cross symbols for the atoms and the resulting molecule. As already discussed
F
that valence electrons are represented by dots. Just to understand sharing, we represent
valence electrons in one atom by dots and in the other atom by crosses. However, remember
k
that all the electrons are identical and cannot be differentiated.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
A shared pair of electrons is also
represented by a dash (-) in a molecule. o
Consider the formation of a bond between two fluorine atoms. Fluorine belongs to Group
o
VIIA, so it has seven electrons in the valence shell. It needs one more electron to attain the
B
electron configuration of a noble gas. Thus two F-atoms
share an electron pair and ach ieve electron configuration
of Ne. For sharing each F-atolm contributes one electron to
a
complete the octet.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
n
Pairs of valence electrons which are not shared between atoms are called unshared
pairs or lone paoirs. Covalenit bond that is formed by the sharing of one electron pair is called single
t
covalent bond. So and molecules contain a single covalent bond. a
Can you explain the formation of covalent bond between H-atom and a F-atom?
N
Sometimes atoms may share two or three electron
pairs to complete octet. Double covalent bonds are the
bonds that are formed by sharing of two electron pairs.

Wahen two identical atoms share electron pairs, both the atoms exert same force on the
shared electron pairs. Such a covalent bond is called non-polar covalent bond. For example,
N
bond in H-H, O = O, NN etc are non-polar covalent bonds. On the other hand, when two
different atoms share electron pair, both the atoms exert different forces on the shared electron
pair. More electronegative atom pulls shared electrons pairs with greater force towards itself
then the other.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
So more electronegative atom partially draws electron density towards itself. This
makes it partially negatively charged and other atom partially positively charged. Such a covalent
bond is called polar covalent bond. The forces of attraction thus
created between the molecules are called intermolecular forces. For example,
4 Structure of Molecules 73
These intermolecular forces are weaker than an ionic or a covalent bond. There are
several types of intermolecular forces.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
We will discuss two of these. Dipole-dipole interactions
occur between polar molecules. Figure 4. 1 shows these interactions

used to protect solid surfaces from the
atmospheric effects. They also give visual n

adhesive or they form bond linkages with

the material being bonded together. What

F
Notice that slightly negative end of polar molecule is weakly attracted to the slightly
positive end of another molecule. Such attracting forces are called dipole-dipole interactions.

Molecules in which hydrogen is covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such
o
as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine is also weakly bonded to a lone pair of electron of another
electronegative atom. This other atoom
may occur in the same molecule Bor in a
nearby molecule. This intermolecular
interaction is called hydrogen bonding. l
Oxygen, nitrogen or flauorine makes
hydrogen very electron-deficient.

interaction of such a highly electron

NNote that both NaCl and CsCl form colorless cubic crystals. Each Na+ ion is surrounded
by six Cl− ions and each Cl− ion is surrounded by six Na+ ions. Internal structure of CsCl is
different from NaCl.
---CHUNK_SEPARATOR---
In CsCl each Cs+ ion is surrounded by eight Cl−ions and each Cl− ion is
surrounded by eight Cs+ ions. Thus in crystals each ion is attracted strongly to each of its
neighbours. The large attracting forces result in a very stable structure. So ionic compounds
have high melting points. For example, melting point of NaCl is 801oC. Teacher’s Point
